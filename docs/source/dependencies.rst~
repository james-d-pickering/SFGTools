Dependencies
_____________
The *sfgtools* module requires Python to use. It was written using Python 3.8.8. It requires the following modules to run:
* **NumPy** - for all the array handling.
* **PyQt5** - for the GUI.
* **Matplotlib** - for plotting data.
* **pathlib** - for file and path handling.
* **lxml** - for handling XML in SPE3.0 files.
* **glob** - for smart file reading.
* **inspect, sys, warnings** - boring Python stuff.

Aside from using the standalone *.exe*, another way to use the program is to install Python using **Anaconda** - this *should* handle dependency problems and install the needed packages for you, and you can then run the GUI from a python shell.
